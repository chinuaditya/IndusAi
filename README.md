task 2
Design Choices:

Simple, Professional Layout: The webpage has a minimalist design to keep the focus on interactivity. A grid layout was used for the drum keys, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
Responsive Design: CSS media queries ensure the page looks good on all devices. The font size and padding for the keys adjust depending on the screen size.
Clear Key Mapping: The keys are labeled (A, S, D, etc.) to ensure users know which key triggers which sound. This avoids any confusion and enhances the user experience.
No Animations: Since you requested no need for animations, the only visual feedback is a color change when a key is pressed.
Challenges:

Mapping Sounds: Ensuring that each key press correctly triggered the associated sound required careful handling of the key codes in JavaScript.
Responsive Design: Making the grid flexible enough to adjust on smaller screens while keeping the layout visually balanced was slightly tricky but achieved using media queries.
